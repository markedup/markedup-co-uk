# Marked up

Simple placeholder page for my personal domain, based on some (very old) tried and tested code.

## To do

- [x] ~Migrate to Webpack Dev Server for local development.~
- [x] Bin jQuery and go with pure ES2015+ for scripted effects.
- [ ] Update layout to use Flexbox or CSS Grid.
- [ ] ~Add PostCSS to automagically add relevant CSS vendor variations.~
- [ ] ~Ensure built static assets are logically organised into discreet, hashed files per type.~
- [x] Simplify tooling and optimisation with [Parcel|https://parceljs.org/].
- [x] Integrate [automated deployment service|https://www.netlify.com/].
- [ ] Look at integrating [Critters](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/critters) into build process.
