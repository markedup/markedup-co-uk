# Marked up

Simple placeholder page for my personal domain, based on some (very old) tried and tested code.

## To do

- [x] Migrate to Webpack Dev Server for local development.
- [x] Bin jQuery and go with pure ES2015+ for scripted effects.
- [ ] Update layout to use Flexbox or CSS Grid.
- [ ] Add PostCSS to automagically add relevant CSS vendor variations.
- [ ] Ensure built static assets are logically organised into discreet, hashed files per type.
- [ ] Integrate automated deployment service.
- [ ] Look at integrating [Critters](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/critters) into build process.
